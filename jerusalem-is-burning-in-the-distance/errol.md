the shadows are all around us Errol<br>
gory are the days and sacrifices<br>
wild are the gods above us<br>
Jerusalem is burning in the distance<br>
<br>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br>
<br>
the shadows are all around us Errol<br>
freedom is the holy grail<br>
the shamans incantations protect us<br>
let the memories burn, we're venturing all alone<br>
<br>
before the mountain birds, fly off towards the stars<br>
before i'll find my own words, devoid of shadows<br>
everything i know, everything i know<br>
the light is here, i believe it's waiting<br>
<br>
the shadows are all around us Errol!<br>
mystical circle within us!<br>
there are no certain paths!<br>
the fire is burning in our hearts!<br>
<br>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br>
